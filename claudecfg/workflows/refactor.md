# Refactor Workflow

## When
Need to refactor code.

## Steps

### 1. Explore
```
@explorer explore code to refactor
```

### 2. Review
```
@code-reviewer what needs refactoring
```

### 3. Design
```
@architect design improved structure
```

### 4. Refactor
Refactor the code while preserving behavior.

### 5. Verify
If successful verification has not already been recorded in the session:

```
@tester run tests and report whether behavior stayed stable
```

### 6. Document
```
@docwriter update docs only if public behavior or operator guidance changed
```

### 7. Review
```
@code-reviewer review refactored code
```

## Command
Just say: "@manager refactor [module/file]"

Manager should keep the refactor workflow moving through structural analysis, implementation, verification, review, and docs when public behavior changed. Hooks enforce successful verification before completion. That successful verification also satisfies the tester side of the refactor gate; otherwise use `@tester`.
