# Implementation plans

Dated implementation plans produced from an approved design, executed via Subagent-Driven Development.

## Convention

- One file per plan: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- A plan breaks the design into bite-sized tasks (2–5 minutes each). Every task carries exact file paths, the concrete change, and its verification step.
- Each task references the design in `docs/specs/` it derives from.
- Commit the plan; the progress ledger names commits per task so work survives compaction.

## Where this fits

Design (docs/specs/) → Plan → Subagent-Driven Development → Review.

The shipped workflow and contracts live in
`plugins/multi-agent-sdlc-crew/references/`.
