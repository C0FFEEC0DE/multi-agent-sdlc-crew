# Project Context

This directory contains Claude Code configuration.

## Profile

This profile is hook-gated:
- discover -> design -> implement -> verify -> review -> docs when behavior changes -> cleanup
- release/deploy automation is intentionally disabled
- session metadata is logged for later audit or dataset indexing
- final completion and subagent handoff are enforced by shell hooks using shared session state for test/lint/build results and summary requirements
- stop-safe no-op replies are only valid when the session made no code or config changes; after code/config edits, keep reporting the actual verification, review outcome, changed files, and remaining risks instead of using a no-change shortcut
- feature work requires successful verification or `@t`, plus `@cr` and one of `@e|@a`
- bugfix work requires successful verification or `@t`, plus `@cr` and one of `@bug|@e|@dbg`
- refactor work requires successful verification or `@t`, plus `@cr` and one of `@a|@e|@hk`
- review work requires `@cr`; docs work requires `@doc`
- broad multi-file or workflow review should usually use `@e` before `@cr`, even though only `@cr` is hook-enforced
- footer and stop-guard formatting are internal protocol details; agents should not expose prefix-matching or footer-repair chatter to the user

## Quick Start

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Commands

- `/debug`, `/test`, `/design`, `/refactor`, `/review`, `/docs`

Commands `/debug`, `/test`, `/design`, `/refactor`, `/review` and the `/docs` skill invoke specialized agents.

## Agents

- `@m` — Manager (coordinates)
- `@e` — Explorer (codebase)
- `@a` — Architect (design)
- `@bug` — Bugbuster (find bugs)
- `@dbg` — Debugger (debug issues)
- `@t` — Tester (design, run, and verify tests)
- `@cr` — Code Reviewer (review)
- `@doc` — Docwriter (documentation)
- `@hk` — Veles (cleanup)

Subagent handoffs normalize aliases, names, and subagent-type fields from both snake_case and camelCase payloads before generic runtime types are considered.
Transcript fallback also recognizes slash-skill loads and agent launch lines like `Code Reviewer(...)` when runtimes omit explicit `SubagentStart`.

## Docs

See `claudecfg/GUIDE.md` for full documentation.

## Repository Automation

Repository CI now includes:
- status badges in `README.md`
- `Validate`, `Hook Tests`, and `Security Scan` on every push and PR
- `Behavior Benchmark` on every push, plus manual runs with model and task-glob overrides, using real `claude -p` inside isolated benchmark fixtures

Agent-level regressions are covered by the golden suite in `bench/tasks/subagents/`. Use `docs/agent-contracts.md` for the contract matrix and the expected benchmark/hook layers for each agent.

OpenRouter-backed Claude Code is configured via repository secrets/variables. See `docs/benchmarking.md`.
