# /refactor

**This command is now a skill that invokes @architect.**

Run refactoring session with the Architect agent.

## When to use
- Code duplication
- Functions too long (>50 lines)
- Bad variable names
- Tests became fragile
- Technical debt cleanup

## Usage
```
/refactor [what to refactor]
```

## Agent Actions
The @architect agent will:
1. Find the structural problem
2. Describe the smallest safe refactoring approach
3. Prepare an implementation and verification checklist for the main thread
4. Call out behavior-preservation constraints
5. Leave a concrete refactor handoff instead of a broad redesign

## Important
- Separate commits for refactor
- Don't add features with refactor
- Leave code cleaner than it was
- This handoff satisfies the refactor structural-analysis branch of the gate together with required `@cr` and either successful verification or `@t`
- The resulting handoff should end with exact footer prefixes recognized by the hooks: `Outcome:`, `Changed files:` or `No files changed:`, `Verification status:`, and either `Remaining risks:` or `Next step:`
